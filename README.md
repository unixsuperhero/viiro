# viiro

i want to experiment with ai and vibe coding.

i want to make a new version of my tool Hiiro,
but completely vibe coded.

i do want to give it somewhat detailed prompts
and give it guidelines about software principles and patterns that i consider
important.

i'm curious to see what it makes and how well it uses/applies good practice.
